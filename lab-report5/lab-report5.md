# Lab Report 5

* To start this lab, we copied test files and a script from Joe's markdown parse file using `cp`. We then ran the script for both our and Joe's markdown parse and copied the results into two different txt files using `bash script > results.txt` and `bash script > results2.txt`.
* Next, we used diff to compare the two results files to find which test files had different results.
